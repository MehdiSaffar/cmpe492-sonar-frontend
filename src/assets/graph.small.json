        "abstract": "The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there\nexist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans,\nfew COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy.\nAt the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the\nbiomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of\nCOVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from\nCOVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset.\nWe extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in\nthe article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a\ndeep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify\nthem accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as\nof May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of\nCOVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that\nCOVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute\nto improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19\nCT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to\ndistinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of\ndiseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from\nnon-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4)\nFrom text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms\nand clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the\ndisease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is\ncomplementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical\nimage analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are\npublicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.",

        "title": "Exploiting Shared Knowledge from Non-COVID Lesions for\n  Annotation-Efficient COVID-19 CT Lung Infection Segmentation",
        "abstract": "The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has\nspread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries.\nAutomatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an\nimportant role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major\nchallenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently,\nthere are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing\nthe potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19\nsegmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven\ncollaborative learning model for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung\ninfection segmentation. The network consists of encoders with the same\narchitecture and a shared decoder. The general encoder is adopted to capture\ngeneral lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, while the\ntarget encoder is adopted to focus on task-specific features of COVID-19\ninfections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated\nfor the subsequent decoder part. To thoroughly exploit shared knowledge between\nCOVID and non-COVID lesions, we develop a collaborative learning scheme to\nregularize the relation consistency between extracted features of given input.\nOther than existing consistency-based methods that simply enforce the\nconsistency of individual predictions, our method enforces the consistency of\nfeature relation among samples, encouraging the model to explore semantic\ninformation from both COVID-19 and non-COVID cases. Extensive experiments on\none public COVID-19 dataset and two public non-COVID datasets show that our\nmethod achieves superior segmentation performance compared with existing\nmethods in the absence of sufficient high-quality COVID-19 annotations.",

Objective: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners and\nresearchers improve the quality of COVID-19 software through an empirical study\nof open source software projects related to COVID-19. Methodology: We use 129\nopen source COVID-19 software projects hosted on GitHub to conduct our\nempirical study. Next, we apply qualitative analysis on 550 bug reports from\nthe collected projects to identify bug categories. Findings: We identify 8 bug\ncategories, which include data bugs i.e., bugs that occur during mining and\nstorage of COVID-19 data. The identified bug categories appear for 7 categories\nof software projects including (i) projects that use statistical modeling to\nperform predictions related to COVID-19, and (ii) medical equipment software\nthat are used to design and implement medical equipment, such as ventilators.\nConclusion: Based on our findings, we advocate for robust statistical model\nconstruction through better synergies between data science practitioners and\npublic health experts. Existence of security bugs in user tracking software\nnecessitates development of tools that will detect data privacy violations and\nsecurity weaknesses.",

Training/testing\ncohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and\n559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification\nof COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and\nrandom forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D\nfeatures extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of\nairspace opacities.\n  Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace\nopacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the\ntypical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised\nhierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and\ncontrol cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83,\nsensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and\n0.83 for the DL-based classifier.

At the same time, people are voluntarily\nusing Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during the pandemic\nwithout similar privacy concerns compared with COVID-19 apps. To better\nunderstand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacy\npolicies, terms & conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly used\nCOVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extract\nand analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps.

Surprisingly, lots\nof people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their\nprivacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps.

To address the above problems, we propose MiniSeg, a\nlightweight deep learning model for efficient COVID-19 segmentation. Compared\nwith traditional segmentation methods, MiniSeg has several significant\nstrengths: i) it only has 83K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii)\nit has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical\ndeployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private\nCOVID-19 data for further improving performance. In addition, we build a\ncomprehensive COVID-19 segmentation benchmark for comparing MiniSeg to\ntraditional methods.",

Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitude\nand shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or\nindirectly modeling \\covid\\ and treating it as exogenous.

These have guided organizations in all fields of the health industry\nto track and minimized the effects of virus. Researchers are required to detect\ncoronaviruses through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural\nlanguage processing, and to gain a complete understanding of the disease.\nCOVID-19 takes place in different countries in the world, with which only big\ndata application and the work of NOSQL databases are suitable. There is a great\nnumber of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases model like: Spark, H2O\nand Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous\namount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers,\nespecially those that work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models\nthrough different APIs and query. In this context, this paper proposes a\nstorage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF) for\nCOVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus\nspreading worldwide by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database,\nCOVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of\nthree Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer.\nThe data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides\ndata into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the\nConnector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving\nand retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends\nresults. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for\nCOVID-19 data (COVID-19-Merging, COVID-19-inside-Hubei and COVID-19-ex-Hubei)\nto test experiments of this study. The results obtained insure the superiority\nof the COVID-QF framework.",

With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every\npatient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques\n(RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity.\nDetecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high\nrisk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already\navailable in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems\nalready digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples\neither. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the\nselection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an\ninpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to\nkeep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in\nCOVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood\nof COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further,\nwe propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients\nusing X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where\nradiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology\nscalable.

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19\nworldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19\nclassification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of\nclinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep\nForest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images.\nSpecifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then,\nin order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the\nrelatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn\nhigh-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature\nselection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the\nredundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively\nincorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed\nAFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of\ncommunity acquired pneumonia (CAP).

        "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to develop and validate computer-aided diagnosis\n(CXDx) system for classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19\npneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray (CXR) images.\n  Materials and Methods: From two public datasets, 1248 CXR images were\nobtained, which included 215, 533, and 500 CXR images of COVID-19 pneumonia\npatients, non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and the healthy samples. The\nproposed CADx system utilized VGG16 as a pre-trained model and combination of\nconventional method and mixup as data augmentation methods. Other types of\npre-trained models were compared with the VGG16-based model. Single type or no\ndata augmentation methods were also evaluated. Splitting of\ntraining/validation/test sets was used when building and evaluating the CADx\nsystem. Three-category accuracy was evaluated for test set with 125 CXR images.\n  Results: The three-category accuracy of the CAD system was 83.6% between\nCOVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy. Sensitivity for\nCOVID-19 pneumonia was more than 90%. The combination of conventional method\nand mixup was more useful than single type or no data augmentation method.\n  Conclusion: This study was able to create an accurate CADx system for the\n3-category classification. Source code of our CADx system is available as open\nsource for COVID-19 research.",

        "abstract": "The explosion of disinformation accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic has\noverloaded fact-checkers and media worldwide, and brought a new major challenge\nto government responses worldwide. Not only is disinformation creating\nconfusion about medical science amongst citizens, but it is also amplifying\ndistrust in policy makers and governments. To help tackle this, we developed\ncomputational methods to categorise COVID-19 disinformation. The COVID-19\ndisinformation categories could be used for a) focusing fact-checking efforts\non the most damaging kinds of COVID-19 disinformation; b) guiding policy makers\nwho are trying to deliver effective public health messages and counter\neffectively COVID-19 disinformation. This paper presents: 1) a corpus\ncontaining what is currently the largest available set of manually annotated\nCOVID-19 disinformation categories; 2) a classification-aware neural topic\nmodel (CANTM) designed for COVID-19 disinformation category classification and\ntopic discovery; 3) an extensive analysis of COVID-19 disinformation categories\nwith respect to time, volume, false type, media type and origin source.",

        "abstract": "Human civilization is experiencing a critical situation that presents itself\nfor a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This virus emerged in late\nDecember 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is\nhighly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and\ncauses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding\nto the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the\nanalysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society.\nNumerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and\nPakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order\nto prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of\nCOVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies.\nFundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to\njudge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this\npaper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and\nPakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use\nvarious models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential\ngrowth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time\ndependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model\nfitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the\nreproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2\n(approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the\nsubcontinent.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health\nand well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against\nCOVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key\nscreening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography.\nMotivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research\ncommunity, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray\n(CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the\nbest of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source\nnetwork designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial\nrelease. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we\ngenerated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases,\nwith the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the\nbest of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes\npredictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain\ndeeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can\naid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible\nand transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on\nrelevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready\nsolution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the\ndescription on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged\nand build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to\naccelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning\nsolutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who\nneed it the most.",

        "abstract": "The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already\ninfected millions of people and is still rapidly spreading all over the globe.\nMost COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic\nmethod is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images.\nHowever, such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to\nlimited diagnostic efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such\nas deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to\nimprove diagnostic efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty\nis the limited availability of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive\nannotation costs and urgent work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This\nmakes the learning of deep diagnosis models very challenging. To address this,\nmotivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19\nand many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct\ndomain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two\nmain challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2)\nthe task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To\naddress them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19\ndiagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy\nvia feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a\nnovel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose\nCOVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations.\nExtensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COVID-DA and its great\npotential for real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "The newly discovered Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been globally\nspreading and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world as of\nits first emergence in late 2019. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown\ndistinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests,\nin particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms\nare mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify\nCOVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation\nand large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image\ninstances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend\nslice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding\nmechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the\ndisease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based\nframework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the\n\"COVID-FACT\". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks\nand is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to\nmake the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentation of the\narea of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first\nstage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID\nand non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies\npositive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19,\ncommunity acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments,\nCOVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity of 94.55%, a\nspecificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while\ndepending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its\ncounterparts.",

Radiology and nucleic acid test (NAT) are\ncomplementary COVID-19 diagnosis methods. In this paper, we present an\nend-to-end multitask learning (MTL) framework (COVID-MTL) that is capable of\nautomated and simultaneous detection (against both radiology and NAT) and\nseverity assessment of COVID-19. COVID-MTL learns different COVID-19 tasks in\nparallel through our novel random-weighted loss function, which assigns\nlearning weights under Dirichlet distribution to prevent task dominance; our\nnew 3D real-time augmentation algorithm (Shift3D) introduces space variances\nfor 3D CNN components by shifting low-level feature representations of\nvolumetric inputs in three dimensions; thereby, the MTL framework is able to\naccelerate convergence and improve joint learning performance compared to\nsingle-task models. By only using chest CT scans, COVID-MTL was trained on 930\nCT scans and tested on separate 399 cases. COVID-MTL achieved AUCs of 0.939 and\n0.846, and accuracies of 90.23% and 79.20% for detection of COVID-19 against\nradiology and NAT, respectively, which outperformed the state-of-the-art\nmodels.

Several recent studies suggest that a\nsignificant number of COVID-19 patients display no physical symptoms\nwhatsoever. Therefore, it is unlikely that these patients will undergo COVID-19\ntest, which increases their chances of unintentionally spreading the virus.\nCurrently, the primary diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 is RT-PCR test on\ncollected respiratory specimens from the suspected case. This requires patients\nto travel to a laboratory facility to be tested, thereby potentially infecting\nothers along the way.It is evident from recent researches that asymptomatic\nCOVID-19 patients cough and breath in a different way than the healthy people.\nSeveral research groups have created mobile and web-platform for crowdsourcing\nthe symptoms, cough and breathing sounds from healthy, COVID-19 and Non-COVID\npatients. Some of these data repositories were made public. We have received\nsuch a repository from Cambridge University team under data-sharing agreement,\nwhere we have cough and breathing sound samples for 582 and 141 healthy and\nCOVID-19 patients, respectively. 87 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, while\nrest of them have cough. We have developed an Android application to\nautomatically screen COVID-19 from the comfort of people homes. Test subjects\ncan simply download a mobile application, enter their symptoms, record an audio\nclip of their cough and breath, and upload the data anonymously to our servers.\nOur backend server converts the audio clip to spectrogram and then apply our\nstate-of-the-art machine learning model to classify between cough sounds\nproduced by COVID-19 patients, as opposed to healthy subjects or those with\nother respiratory conditions. The system can detect asymptomatic COVID-19\npatients with a sensitivity more than 91%.",

Our analysis suggests that\nrapid and effective decision making is crucial to control human mobility and,\ntherefore, COVID-19 epidemics. Until a vaccine is available, reimplementations\nof mobility restrictions in response to the increase of new COVID-19 cases\nmight need to be considered in Arizona and beyond.",

        "abstract": "One of the main challenges in containing the Coronoavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19) pandemic stems from the difficulty in carrying out efficient mass\ndiagnosis over large populations. The leading method to test for COVID-19\ninfection utilizes qualitative polymerase chain reaction, implemented using\ndedicated machinery which can simultaneously process a limited amount of\nsamples. A candidate method to increase the test throughput is to examine\npooled samples comprised of a mixture of samples from different patients. In\nthis work we study pooling-based COVID-19 tests. We identify the specific\nrequirements of COVID-19 testing, including the need to characterize the\ninfection level and to operate in a one-shot fashion, which limit the\napplication of traditional group-testing (GT) methods. We then propose a\nmulti-level GT scheme, designed specifically to meet the unique requirements of\nCOVID-19 tests, while exploiting the strength of GT theory to enable accurate\nrecovery using much fewer tests than patients. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate that multi-level GT reliably and efficiently detects the infection\nlevels, while achieving improved accuracy over previously proposed one-shot\nCOVID-19 pooled-testing methods.",

METHODS We developed a modified stacked\nauto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We\napplied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19\nacross China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by\nWHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms\nto group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.\nRESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across\nChina from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,\nthe estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step\nforecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease discovered in 2019\nand currently in outbreak across the world. Lung injury with severe respiratory\nfailure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks\nefficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory\nfailure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike\nprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in\nCOVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified\ntetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating\nlung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene\nexpression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human\nCOVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that\ntwelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515\ncells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues,\nincluding signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as\nTNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these\ntwelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such\nas RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of\ntwelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also\nuniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In\nsummary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms\nleading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and\nCGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.",

        "abstract": "Radiological image is currently adopted as the visual evidence for COVID-19\ndiagnosis in clinical. Using deep models to realize automated infection\nmeasurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on\nradiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data\nsystematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we\nexplore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a\nsingle radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological\nimages. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called\nCoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given\ncondition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our\nCoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of\nCOVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution\nradiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep\nclassification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from\nCoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results\nare significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely\nsmall number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data\naugmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset\n(2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the\nperformance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on\nlarge dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19\ndiagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur codes are made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/PengyiZhang/CoSinGAN.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing, fluid nature of the COVID-19 pandemic requires individuals to\nregularly seek information about best health practices, local community\nspreading, and public health guidelines. In the absence of a unified response\nto the pandemic in the United States and clear, consistent directives from\nfederal and local officials, people have used social media to collectively\ncrowdsource COVID-19 elites, a small set of trusted COVID-19 information\nsources. We take a census of COVID-19 crowdsourced elites in the United States\nwho have received sustained attention on Twitter during the pandemic. Using a\nmixed methods approach with a panel of Twitter users linked to public U.S.\nvoter registration records, we find that journalists, media outlets, and\npolitical accounts have been consistently amplified around COVID-19, while\nepidemiologists, public health officials, and medical professionals make up\nonly a small portion of all COVID-19 elites on Twitter. We show that COVID-19\nelites vary considerably across demographic groups, and that there are notable\nracial, geographic, and political similarities and disparities between various\ngroups and the demographics of their elites. With this variation in mind, we\ndiscuss the potential for using the disproportionate online voice of\ncrowdsourced COVID-19 elites to equitably promote timely public health\ninformation and mitigate rampant misinformation.",

        "abstract": "Propose: Troubling countries one after another, the COVID-19 pandemic has\ndramatically affected the health and well-being of the world's population. The\ndisease may continue to persist more extensively due to the increasing number\nof new cases daily, the rapid spread of the virus, and delay in the PCR\nanalysis results. Therefore, it is necessary to consider developing assistive\nmethods for detecting and diagnosing the COVID-19 to eradicate the spread of\nthe novel coronavirus among people. Based on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), automated detection systems have shown promising results of diagnosing\npatients with the COVID-19 through radiography; thus, they are introduced as a\nworkable solution to the COVID-19 diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Based on\nthe enhancement of the classical visual geometry group (VGG) network with the\nconvolutional COVID block (CCBlock), an efficient screening model was proposed\nin this study to diagnose and distinguish patients with the COVID-19 from those\nwith pneumonia and the healthy people through radiography. The model testing\ndataset included 1,828 x-ray images available on public platforms. 310 images\nwere showing confirmed COVID-19 cases, 864 images indicating pneumonia cases,\nand 654 images showing healthy people. Results: According to the test results,\nenhancing the classical VGG network with radiography provided the highest\ndiagnosis performance and overall accuracy of 98.52% for two classes as well as\naccuracy of 95.34% for three classes. Conclusions: According to the results,\nusing the enhanced VGG deep neural network can help radiologists automatically\ndiagnose the COVID-19 through radiography.",

        "abstract": "Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has drastically overwhelmed more than 200\ncountries affecting millions and claiming almost 1 million lives, since its\nemergence in late 2019. This highly contagious disease can easily spread, and\nif not controlled in a timely fashion, can rapidly incapacitate healthcare\nsystems. The current standard diagnosis method, the Reverse Transcription\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT- PCR), is time consuming, and subject to low\nsensitivity. Chest Radiograph (CXR), the first imaging modality to be used, is\nreadily available and gives immediate results.

        "abstract": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been posing severe threat to public\nhealth around the world by causing the infectious coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19). A key challenge of controlling COVID-19 is the large proportion of\nasymptomatic COVID-19 cases (ACCs) that makes breaking the transmission chains\neven harder. Unfortunately, till now there is still a lack of cost-effective\napproaches to detect ACCs except doing a medical screening of the entire\npopulation. This paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal\nEpisodic Memory for COVID-19 tracing (STEM-COVID) for identifying ACCs from\ncontact tracing data. Based on fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (fusion ART),\nSTEM-COVID provides a mechanism to encode the collective spatio-temporal\nepisodic memory traces of individuals, based on which parallel searches of ACCs\ncan be performed in a computationally efficient manner by pooling together the\nepisodic traces of the identified positive cases. To illustrate the\neffectiveness of STEM-COVID, a simulation model of the COVID-19 spreading is\nimplemented based on recent epidemiological findings on ACCs. The experimental\nresults based on multiple simulation scenarios show that the STEM-COVID model\nis able to identify ACCs with a reasonably high level of accuracy and\nefficiency.",

        "abstract": "Background: A major question in Covid-19 research is whether democracies\nhandled the Covid-19 pandemic crisis better or worse than authoritarian\ncountries. However, it is important to consider the issues of democracy versus\nauthoritarianism, and state fragility, when examining official Covid-19 death\ncounts in research, because these factors can influence the accurate reporting\nof pandemic deaths by governments. In contrast, excess deaths are less prone to\nvariability in differences in definitions of Covid-19 deaths and testing\ncapacities across countries. Here we use excess pandemic deaths to explore\npotential relationships between political systems and public health outcomes.\n  Methods: We address these issues by comparing the official government\nCovid-19 death counts in a well-established John Hopkins database to the\ngenerally more reliable excess mortality measure of Covid-19 deaths, taken from\nthe recently released World Mortality Dataset. We put the comparison in the\ncontext of the political and fragile state dimensions.\n  Findings: We find (1) significant potential underreporting of Covid-19 deaths\nby authoritarian governments and governments with high state fragility and (2)\nsubstantial geographic variation among countries and regions with regard to\nstandard democracy indices. Additionally, we find that more authoritarian\ngovernments are (weakly) associated with more excess deaths during the pandemic\nthan democratic governments.\n  Interpretations: The inhibition and censorship of information flows, inherent\nto authoritarian states, likely results in major inaccuracies in pandemic\nstatistics that confound global public health analyses. Thus, both excess\npandemic deaths and official Covid-19 death counts should be examined in\nstudies using death as an outcome variable.",

COVID-19\nis extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early\ndiagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health\ncare professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition\nand flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test,\nhowever, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity.\nComputed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal\nspecific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung\ninfections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging.\nConsequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs,\nhowever, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and\nrequire large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework\nbased on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of\nhandling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and\nrapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images\nshow that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models.

To further improve diagnosis\ncapabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training based on a new dataset constructed\nfrom an external dataset of X-ray images. Pre-training with a dataset of\nsimilar nature further improved accuracy to 98.3% and specificity to 98.6%.",

Daily, the number of\nthe confirmed cases are increasing rapidly, number of the suspect increases,\nbased on the symptoms that accompany this disease, and unfortunately number of\nthe deaths also increase. Therefore, with these increases in number of cases\naround the world, it becomes hard to manage all these cases information with\ndifferent situations; if the patient either injured or suspect with which\nsymptoms that appeared on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need to\nconstruct a multi-dimensional system to store and analyze the generated\nlarge-scale data. In this paper, a Comprehensive Storing System for COVID-19\ndata using Apache Spark (CSS-COVID) is proposed, to handle and manage the\nproblem caused by increasing the number of COVID-19 daily. CSS-COVID helps in\ndecreasing the processing time for querying and storing COVID-19 daily data.\nCSS-COVID consists of three stages, namely, inserting and indexing, storing,\nand querying stage. In the inserting stage, data is divided into subsets and\nthen index each subset separately. The storing stage uses set of storing-nodes\nto store data, while querying stage is responsible for handling the querying\nprocesses. Using Apache Spark in CSS-COVID leverages the performance of dealing\nwith large-scale data of the coronavirus disease injured whom increase daily. A\nset of experiments are applied, using real COVID-19 Datasets, to prove the\nefficiency of CSS-COVID in indexing large-scale data.",

To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays by\nradiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based\non ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray.\nThree ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and c) were retrained using Dataset_A\n(1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and 1763\nnon-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19),\nrespectively, to classify (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or\nnon-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19.

For plain CXRs, it was observed that InceptionV3\noutperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities\nof 99.5%, 93.1%, and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images,\nrespectively. In contrast, for segmented CXRs, InceptionV3 outperformed using\nthe original CXR dataset and achieved sensitivities of 96.94%, 79.68%, and\n90.26% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. All\nnetworks showed high COVID-19 detection sensitivity (>96%) with the segmented\nlung images. This indicates the unique radiographic signature of COVID-19 cases\nin the eyes of AI, which is often a challenging task for medical doctors.",

        "abstract": "Future SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak COVID-XX might possibly occur during the\nnext years. However the pathology in humans is so recent that many clinical\naspects, like early detection of complications, side effects after recovery or\nearly screening, are currently unknown. In spite of the number of cases of\nCOVID-19, its rapid spread putting many sanitary systems in the edge of\ncollapse has hindered proper collection and analysis of the data related to\nCOVID-19 clinical aspects. We describe an interdisciplinary initiative that\nintegrates clinical research, with image diagnostics and the use of new\ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence and radiomics with the aim of\nclarifying some of SARS-CoV-2 open questions. The whole initiative addresses 3\nmain points: 1) collection of standardize data including images, clinical data\nand analytics; 2) COVID-19 screening for its early diagnosis at primary care\ncenters; 3) define radiomic signatures of COVID-19 evolution and associated\npathologies for the early treatment of complications. In particular, in this\npaper we present a general overview of the project, the experimental design and\nfirst results of X-ray COVID-19 detection using a classic approach based on HoG\nand feature selection. Our experiments include a comparison to some recent\nmethods for COVID-19 screening in X-Ray and an exploratory analysis of the\nfeasibility of X-Ray COVID-19 screening. Results show that classic approaches\ncan outperform deep-learning methods in this experimental setting, indicate the\nfeasibility of early COVID-19 screening and that non-COVID infiltration is the\ngroup of patients most similar to COVID-19 in terms of radiological description\nof X-ray. Therefore, an efficient COVID-19 screening should be complemented\nwith other clinical data to better discriminate these cases.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the number of patients with COVID-19 has significantly increased.\nThus, there is an urgent need for developing treatments for COVID-19. Drug\nrepurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new\nmedical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and\nbroadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other\ndiseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in\nthe near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes\nmellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma\nare at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of\ncomorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To\nreduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building\na network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs.\nFirst, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug\nnetwork (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components\nfor diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681\nhuman genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common\ncomorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for\nCOVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms. The scoring\nalgorithms determined the priority of recommendations by utilizing graph-based\nsemi-supervised learning. From the predicted scores, we recommended 30 drugs,\nincluding dexamethasone, resveratrol, methotrexate, indomethacin, quercetin,\netc., as repurposable drugs for COVID-19, and the results were verified with\ndrugs that have been under clinical trials. The list of drugs via a data-driven\ncomputational approach could help reduce trial-and-error in finding treatment\nfor COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "We present a machine learning based COVID-19 cough classifier which is able\nto discriminate COVID-19 positive coughs from both COVID-19 negative and\nhealthy coughs recorded on a smartphone. This type of screening is non-contact\nand easily applied, and could help reduce workload in testing centers as well\nas limit transmission by recommending early self-isolation to those who have a\ncough suggestive of COVID-19. The two dataset used in this study include\nsubjects from all six continents and contain both forced and natural coughs.\nThe publicly available Coswara dataset contains 92 COVID-19 positive and 1079\nhealthy subjects, while the second smaller dataset was collected mostly in\nSouth Africa and contains 8 COVID-19 positive and 13 COVID-19 negative subjects\nwho have undergone a SARS-CoV laboratory test. Dataset skew was addressed by\napplying synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) and leave-p-out cross\nvalidation was used to train and evaluate classifiers. Logistic regression\n(LR), support vector machines (SVM), multilayer perceptrons (MLP),\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN), long-short term memory (LSTM) and a\nresidual-based neural network architecture (Resnet50) were considered as\nclassifiers. Our results show that the Resnet50 classifier was best able to\ndiscriminate between the COVID-19 positive and the healthy coughs with an area\nunder the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.98 while a LSTM classifier was best able to\ndiscriminate between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative coughs with an\nAUC of 0.94. The LSTM classifier achieved these results using 13 features\nselected by sequential forward search (SFS). Since it can be implemented on a\nsmartphone, cough audio classification is cost-effective and easy to apply and\ndeploy, and therefore is potentially a useful and viable means of non-contact\nCOVID-19 screening.",

This paper explores the\neffect of various popular image enhancement techniques and states the effect of\neach of them on the detection performance. We have compiled the largest X-ray\ndataset called COVQU-20, consisting of 18,479 normal, non-COVID lung opacity\nand COVID-19 CXR images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest\npublic COVID positive database. Ground glass opacity is the common symptom\nreported in COVID-19 pneumonia patients and so a mixture of 3616 COVID-19, 6012\nnon-COVID lung opacity, and 8851 normal chest X-ray images were used to create\nthis dataset. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram\nequalization, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, image\ncomplement, gamma correction, and Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique were\nused to improve COVID-19 detection accuracy. Six different Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) were investigated in this study. Gamma correction technique\noutperforms other enhancement techniques in detecting COVID-19 from standard\nand segmented lung CXR images. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, f1-score,\nand specificity in the detection of COVID-19 with gamma correction on CXR\nimages were 96.29%, 96.28%, 96.29%, 96.28% and 96.27% respectively. The\naccuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity were 95.11 %, 94.55\n%, 94.56 %, 94.53 % and 95.59 % respectively for segmented lung images. The\nproposed approach with very high and comparable performance will boost the fast\nand robust COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 crisis has led to the sharpest collapse in the Spanish trade of\ngoods and services in recent decades. The containment measures adopted to\narrest the spread of the virus have caused an especially intense fall of trade\nin services. Spain's export specialization in transport equipment, capital and\noutdoor goods, and services that rely on the movement of people has made the\nCOVID-19 trade crisis more intense in Spain than in the rest of the European\nUnion. However, the nature of the collapse suggests that trade in goods can\nrecover swiftly when the health crisis ends.

In this study, we collected\nand analyzed nearly thirty thousand publicly available complete genome\nsequences for COVID-19 virus from 79 different countries, the previously known\nflu-causing coronaviruses (HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1) and\nthe lethal, pathogenic viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria, Lassa, Yamagata, Ebola,\nand Dengue.

Strikingly, we observed that the\ndivergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increased\nfrom December 2019 to May 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is actively evolving in\nhuman hosts. In this paper, we first propose a novel MLCS algorithm NP-MLCS1\nfor the big sequence analysis, which can calculate the common model for\nCOVID-19 complete genome sequences to provide important information for vaccine\nand antibody development.

Several studies have\nshown that tomographic patterns seen on chest Computed Tomography (CT), such as\nground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving pattern, are\ncorrelated with the disease severity and progression. CT imaging can thus\nemerge as an important modality for the management of COVID-19 patients.\nAI-based solutions can be used to support CT based quantitative reporting and\nmake reading efficient and reproducible if quantitative biomarkers, such as the\nPercentage of Opacity (PO), can be automatically computed. However, COVID-19\nhas posed unique challenges to the development of AI, specifically concerning\nthe availability of appropriate image data and annotations at scale. In this\npaper, we propose to use synthetic datasets to augment an existing COVID-19\ndatabase to tackle these challenges. We train a Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN) to inpaint COVID-19 related tomographic patterns on chest CTs from\npatients without infectious diseases. Additionally, we leverage location priors\nderived from manually labeled COVID-19 chest CTs patients to generate\nappropriate abnormality distributions. Synthetic data are used to improve both\nlung segmentation and segmentation of COVID-19 patterns by adding 20% of\nsynthetic data to the real COVID-19 training data. We collected 2143 chest CTs,\ncontaining 327 COVID-19 positive cases, acquired from 12 sites across 7\ncountries. By testing on 100 COVID-19 positive and 100 control cases, we show\nthat synthetic data can help improve both lung segmentation (+6.02% lesion\ninclusion rate) and abnormality segmentation (+2.78% dice coefficient), leading\nto an overall more accurate PO computation (+2.82% Pearson coefficient).",

Deep learning neural networks have a great potential for\nbuilding COVID-19 triage systems and detecting COVID-19 patients, especially\npatients with low severity. Unfortunately, current databases do not allow\nbuilding such systems as they are highly heterogeneous and biased towards\nsevere cases.

        "abstract": "This study develops a framework for quantification of the impact of changes\nin population mobility due to social distancing on the COVID-19 infection\ngrowth rate. Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological\nmodel we establish that under some mild assumptions the growth rate of COVID-19\ndeaths is a time-delayed approximation of the growth rate of COVID-19\ninfections. We then hypothesize that the growth rate of COVID-19 infections is\na function of population mobility, which leads to a statistical model that\npredicts the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths as a delayed function of population\nmobility. The parameters of the statistical model directly reveal the growth\nrate of infections, the mobility-dependent transmission rate, the\nmobility-independent recovery rate, and the critical mobility, below which\nCOVID-19 growth rate becomes negative. We fitted the proposed statistical model\non publicly available data from 14 countries where daily death counts exceeded\n100 for more than 3 days as of May 6th, 2020. The publicly available Google\nMobility Index (GMI) was used as a measure of population mobility at the\ncountry level. Our results show that the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths can be\naccurately estimated 20 days ahead as a quadratic function of the transit\ncategory of GMI (adjusted R-squared = 0.784). The estimated 95% confidence\ninterval for the critical mobility is in the range between 36.1% and 47.6% of\nthe pre-COVID-19 mobility. This result indicates that a significant reduction\nin population mobility is needed to reverse the growth of COVID-19 epidemic.\nMoreover, the quantitative relationship established herein suggests that a\nreadily available, population-level metric such as GMI can be a useful\nindicator of the course of COVID-19 epidemic.",

Many individuals who become infected have pre-existing conditions\nthat may interact with COVID-19 to increase symptom severity and mortality\nrisk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative about\nindividual risk of severe illness and mortality. Accurately determining how\ncomorbidities are associated with severe symptoms and mortality would thus\ngreatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision.\n  Methods: To assess the interaction of patient comorbidities with COVID-19\nseverity and mortality we performed a meta-analysis of the published global\nliterature, and machine learning predictive analysis using an aggregated\nCOVID-19 global dataset.\n  Results: Our meta-analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2\ndiabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated with\nCOVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning\nclassification using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD,\nCKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the\nmost significant features for classifying those deceased versus those who\nsurvived COVID-19.

Methods: We analyzed the temporal distribution of EMS\ncalls in the Austin-Travis County area between January 1st, 2019 and December\n31st, 2020. Change point detection was performed to identify critical dates\nmarking changes in EMS call distributions and time series regression was\napplied for forecasting Covid-19 EMS incidents. Results: Two critical dates\nmarked the impact of Covid-19 on the distribution of EMS calls: March 17th,\nwhen the daily number of non-pandemic EMS incidents dropped significantly, and\nMay 13th, by which the daily number of EMS calls climbed back to 75% of the\nnumber in pre-Covid-19 time. New daily count of the hospitalization of Covid-19\npatients alone proves a powerful predictor of the number of pandemic EMS calls,\nwith an r2 value equal to 0.85. In particular, for every 2.5 cases where EMS\ntakes a Covid-19 patient to a hospital, 1 person is admitted. Conclusion: The\nmean daily number of non-pandemic EMS demand was significantly less than the\nperiod prior to Covid-19 pandemic. The number of EMS calls for Covid-19\nsymptoms can be predicted from the daily new hospitalization of Covid-19\npatients. These findings may be of interest to EMS departments as they plan for\nfuture pandemics, including the ability to predict pandemic-related calls in an\neffort to adjust a targeted response.",

The\nmultivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that\ninfluence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination.\n  Results: 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the\nCOVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness\nto take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the\nvaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine's efficacy and safety or\nCOVID-19 become deadlier in Bangladesh.

The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict\nCOVID-19 evolution in United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea which have\nresponded differently to monitoring and mitigating COVID-19 so far, although\nthese predictions contain high uncertainty due to the intrinsic change of the\nmaximum infected population and the infection/recovery rates within the\ndifferent countries.

In this scenario, machine learning (ML)\nand deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect\nabnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which\nmay be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the\navailable COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks.\nTherefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning\n(DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on\na related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four\nclasses \\textit{viz.} $normal$, $pneumonia$, $other\\_disease$, and $Covid-19$.\nA 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using\nchest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the\npossibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall\naccuracy was measured as $90.13\\% \\pm 0.14$. In order to get an idea about the\nCOVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class\nActivation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more\nattention during the classification. This was found to strongly correlate with\nclinical findings, as validated by experts.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 is sweeping the world with deadly consequences. Its contagious\nnature and clinical similarity to other pneumonias make separating subjects\ncontracted with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia a priority and a\nchallenge. However, COVID-19 testing has been greatly limited by the\navailability and cost of existing methods, even in developed countries like the\nUS. Intrigued by the wide availability of routine blood tests, we propose to\nleverage them for COVID-19 testing using the power of machine learning. Two\nproven-robust machine learning model families, random forests (RFs) and support\nvector machines (SVMs), are employed to tackle the challenge. Trained on blood\ndata from 208 moderate COVID-19 subjects and 86 subjects with non-COVID-19\nmoderate viral pneumonia, the best result is obtained in an SVM-based\nclassifier with an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 80%,\nand a precision of 92%. The results are found explainable from both machine\nlearning and medical perspectives. A privacy-protected web portal is set up to\nhelp medical personnel in their practice and the trained models are released\nfor developers to further build other applications. We hope our results can\nhelp the world fight this pandemic and welcome clinical verification of our\napproach on larger populations.",

However, these\nchanges, hinder them from performing COVID-19 diagnosis. We constructed a\nmachine learning predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis. The model was based\nand cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5,333 patients with various\nbacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected\noperational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 97.9%. The\ncross-validated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. The five most useful\nroutine blood parameters for COVID19 diagnosis according to the feature\nimportance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were MCHC, eosinophil count,\nalbumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. tSNE visualization showed\nthat the blood parameters of the patients with severe COVID-19 course are more\nlike the parameters of bacterial than viral infection. The reported diagnostic\naccuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest\nCT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now\nhave initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients\nwith a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies\nto confirm the diagnosis.

        "abstract": "The Bacille Calmette-Gu\\'erin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity\nbenefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized\nthat it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found\nthat countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu\\'erin (BCG) childhood\nvaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead,\nthis paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took\nplace in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led\nto a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us\nto estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with\ncross-country comparisons. Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were\nrecorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change,\nrepresenting 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used\nregression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19\nrelated outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high\nprecision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled\ntrial. The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations\nwere 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]),\nrespectively. We can thus reject with 95\\% confidence that universal BCG\nvaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of\nhospitalizations by more than 24%. While the effect of a recent vaccination\nmust be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at\nbirth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.",

The virus transmits rapidly; it has\na basic reproductive number R of 2.2-2.7. In March 2020, the World Health\nOrganization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 is currently\naffecting more than 200 countries with 6M active cases. An effective testing\nstrategy for COVID-19 is crucial to controlling the outbreak but the demand for\ntesting surpasses the availability of test kits that use Reverse Transcription\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In this paper, we present a technique to\nscreen for COVID-19 using artificial intelligence. Our technique takes only\nseconds to screen for the presence of the virus in a patient. We collected a\ndataset of chest X-ray images and trained several popular deep convolution\nneural network-based models (VGG, MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet,\nInceptionResNet) to classify the chest X-rays. Unsatisfied with these models,\nwe then designed and built a Residual Attention Network that was able to screen\nCOVID-19 with a testing accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of 100%. A\nfeature maps visual of our model show areas in a chest X-ray which are\nimportant for classification. Our work can help to increase the adaptation of\nAI-assisted applications in clinical practice.

This has led to both corpora for biomedical articles related to\nCOVID-19 (such as the CORD-19 corpus (Wang et al., 2020)) as well as search\nengines to query such data. While most research in search engines is performed\nin the academic field of information retrieval (IR), most academic search\nengines$\\unicode{x2013}$though rigorously evaluated$\\unicode{x2013}$are\nsparsely utilized, while major commercial web search engines (e.g., Google,\nBing) dominate. This relates to COVID-19 because it can be expected that\ncommercial search engines deployed for the pandemic will gain much higher\ntraction than those produced in academic labs, and thus leads to questions\nabout the empirical performance of these search tools. This paper seeks to\nempirically evaluate two such commercial search engines for COVID-19, produced\nby Google and Amazon, in comparison to the more academic prototypes evaluated\nin the context of the TREC-COVID track (Roberts et al., 2020). We performed\nseveral steps to reduce bias in the available manual judgments in order to\nensure a fair comparison of the two systems with those submitted to TREC-COVID.\nWe find that the top-performing system from TREC-COVID on bpref metric\nperformed the best among the different systems evaluated in this study on all\nthe metrics. This has implications for developing biomedical retrieval systems\nfor future health crises as well as trust in popular health search engines.",

The problem is not only that they\nare difficult to identify and test, but also that it is believed that they may\nconstitute the bulk of the cases and could be crucial in the pandemic equation.\n  Methods: We present a novel algorithm to extract the number of these mild\ncases by correlating a COVID-line calls to reported cases in given districts.\nThe key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the\nnumber of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported\ncases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be\nproportional to the district population.\n  Results: We find that for Buenos Aires Province, in addition to the\nbackground, there are in signal 6.6 +/- 0.4 calls per each reported COVID-19\ncase. Using this we estimate in Buenos Aires Province 20 +/- 2 COVID-19\nsymptomatic cases for each one reported.\n  Conclusions: A very simple algorithm that models the COVID-line calls as sum\nof signal plus background allows to estimate the crucial number of the rate of\nsymptomatic to reported COVID-19 cases in a given district. The result from\nthis method is an early and inexpensive estimate and should be contrasted to\nother methods such as serology and/or massive testing.",

        "abstract": "Early identification of COVID-19 using a deep model trained on Chest X-Ray\nand CT images has gained considerable attention from researchers to speed up\nthe process of identification of active COVID-19 cases. These deep models act\nas an aid to hospitals that suffer from the unavailability of specialists or\nradiologists, specifically in remote areas. Various deep models have been\nproposed to detect the COVID-19 cases, but few works have been performed to\nprevent the deep models against adversarial attacks capable of fooling the deep\nmodel by using a small perturbation in image pixels. This paper presents an\nevaluation of the performance of deep COVID-19 models against adversarial\nattacks. Also, it proposes an efficient yet effective Fuzzy Unique Image\nTransformation (FUIT) technique that downsamples the image pixels into an\ninterval. The images obtained after the FUIT transformation are further\nutilized for training the secure deep model that preserves high accuracy of the\ndiagnosis of COVID-19 cases and provides reliable defense against the\nadversarial attacks. The experiments and results show the proposed model\nprevents the deep model against the six adversarial attacks and maintains high\naccuracy to classify the COVID-19 cases from the Chest X-Ray image and CT image\nDatasets. The results also recommend that a careful inspection is required\nbefore practically applying the deep models to diagnose the COVID-19 cases.",

We study these possible changes using two\napproaches: a short-term analysis through which changes during the first six\nmonths of the outbreak are examined for both COVID-19 related papers and\nnon-COVID-19 related papers; and a longitudinal approach through which changes\nare examined in comparison to the previous four years. Our results show that\nthe pandemic has so far had a tremendous effect on all examined accounts of\nscholarly publications: A sharp increase in publication volume has been\nwitnessed and it can be almost entirely attributed to the pandemic; a\nsignificantly faster mean time to acceptance for COVID-19 papers is apparent,\nand it has (partially) come at the expense of non-COVID-19 papers; and a\nsignificant reduction in international collaboration for COVID-19 papers has\nalso been identified. As the pandemic continues to spread, these changes may\ncause a slow down in research in non-COVID-19 biomedical fields and bring about\na lower rate of international collaboration.",

        "abstract": "Revealing spatiotemporal evolution regularity in the spatial diffusion of\nepidemics is helpful for preventing and controlling the spread of epidemics.\nBased on the real-time COVID-19 datasets by prefecture-level cities and date,\nthis paper is aimed at exploring the multifractal scaling in spatial diffusion\npattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese\nmainland. The ArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract\nspatial data and the least square calculation is used to calculate fractal\nparameters. The results show multifractal distribution of COVID-19 pandemic in\nChina. The generalized correlation dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped\ncurves, but the fractal dimension values significantly exceeds the Euclidean\ndimension of embedding space when moment order q<<0. The local singularity\nspectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves, which slant to right. The fractal\ndimension growth curves are shown as quasi S-shaped curves. From these\nspectrums and growth curves, the main conclusions can be drawn as follows.\nFirst, self-similar patterns developed in the process of Covid-19 pandemic,\nwhich seem be dominated by multi-scaling law. Second, the spatial pattern of\nCOVID-19 across China can be characterized by global clustering with local\ndisordered diffusion. Third, the spatial diffusion process of COVID-19 in China\nexperienced four stages, i.e., initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage, the\nhierarchical diffusion stage, and finally the contraction stage. This study\nsuggests that multifractal theory can be utilized to characterize\nspatio-temporal diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic, and the case analyses may be\ninstructive for further exploring natural laws of spatial diffusion.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most significant public health disaster\nsince the 1918 influenza pandemic. During pandemics such as COVID-19, timely\nand reliable spatio-temporal forecasting of epidemic dynamics is crucial. Deep\nlearning-based time series models for forecasting have recently gained\npopularity and have been successfully used for epidemic forecasting. Here we\nfocus on the design and analysis of deep learning-based models for COVID-19\nforecasting. We implement multiple recurrent neural network-based deep learning\nmodels and combine them using the stacking ensemble technique. In order to\nincorporate the effects of multiple factors in COVID-19 spread, we consider\nmultiple sources such as COVID-19 confirmed and death case count data and\ntesting data for better predictions. To overcome the sparsity of training data\nand to address the dynamic correlation of the disease, we propose\nclustering-based training for high-resolution forecasting. The methods help us\nto identify the similar trends of certain groups of regions due to various\nspatio-temporal effects. We examine the proposed method for forecasting weekly\nCOVID-19 new confirmed cases at county-, state-, and country-level. A\ncomprehensive comparison between different time series models in COVID-19\ncontext is conducted and analyzed. The results show that simple deep learning\nmodels can achieve comparable or better performance when compared with more\ncomplicated models. We are currently integrating our methods as a part of our\nweekly forecasts that we provide state and federal authorities.",

As\nchest radiography, such as chest X-ray (CXR) and CT computed tomography (CT),\nis a possible way for screening COVID-19, developing an automatic image\nclassification tool is immensely helpful for detecting the patients with\nCOVID-19.

        "abstract": "Because the infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\n(COVID-19) causes the pneumonia-like effect in the lungs, the examination of\nchest x-rays can help to diagnose the diseases. For automatic analysis of\nimages, they are represented in machines by a set of semantic features. Deep\nLearning (DL) models are widely used to extract features from images. General\ndeep features may not be appropriate to represent chest x-rays as they have a\nfew semantic regions. Though the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) based features are\nshown to be more appropriate for x-ray type of images, existing BoVW features\nmay not capture enough information to differentiate COVID-19 infection from\nother pneumonia-related infections. In this paper, we propose a new BoVW method\nover deep features, called Bag of Deep Visual Words (BoDVW), by removing the\nfeature map normalization step and adding deep features normalization step on\nthe raw feature maps. This helps to preserve the semantics of each feature map\nthat may have important clues to differentiate COVID-19 from pneumonia. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our proposed BoDVW features in chest x-rays\nclassification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to diagnose COVID-19. Our\nresults on a publicly available COVID-19 x-ray dataset reveal that our features\nproduce stable and prominent classification accuracy, particularly\ndifferentiating COVID-19 infection from other pneumonia, in shorter computation\ntime compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Thus, it is critical to\ndetect and combat such misinformation. Recently, deep learning models using\nnatural language processing techniques, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers), have achieved great successes in detecting\nmisinformation. In this paper, we proposed an explainable natural language\nprocessing model based on DistilBERT and SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations)\nto combat misinformation about COVID-19 due to their efficiency and\neffectiveness. First, we collected a dataset of 984 claims about COVID-19 with\nfact checking.

The performance on\nboth datasets was better than traditional machine learning models. Second, in\norder to boost public trust in model prediction, we employed SHAP to improve\nmodel explainability, which was further evaluated using a between-subjects\nexperiment with three conditions, i.e., text (T), text+SHAP explanation (TSE),\nand text+SHAP explanation+source and evidence (TSESE).

The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a\ndetrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of\ninfected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early\nresults suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive\nof COVID-19.

Therefore, in this\nresearch, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by\ndeveloping an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based\nmodel called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images\nproduced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for\nCOVID-19 detection.

As\npart of the analysis, statistical models were developed to provide an insight\ninto both the relationships between the levels of non compliance with COVID-19\nregulations and demographic variables and the respondent attributes which might\naffect future public transport usage. In general, the study confirmed\nsignificant reductions in traffic activity, among respondents during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic associated with walking, driving a car and either using a bus\nor train. The respondents also indicated that they anticipated they would\ncontinue to make less use of buses and trains at the end of the pandemic.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to evaluate the possibility of using cough audio\nrecordings (spontaneous or simulated) to detect sound patterns in people who\nare diagnosed with COVID-19. The research question that led our work was: what\nis the sensitivity and specificity of a machine learning based COVID-19 cough\nclassifier, using RT-PCR tests as gold standard?\n  SETTING: The audio samples that were collected for this study belong to\nindividuals who were swabbed in the City of Buenos Aires in 20 public and 1\nprivate facilities where RT-PCR studies were carried out on patients suspected\nof COVID, and 14 out-of-hospital isolation units for patients with confirmed\nCOVID mild cases. The audios were collected through the Buenos Aires city\ngovernment WhatsApp chatbot that was specifically designed to address citizen\ninquiries related to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).\n  PARTICIPANTS: The data collected corresponds to 2821 individuals who were\nswabbed in the City of Buenos Aires, between August 11 and December 2, 2020.\nIndividuals were divided into 1409 that tested positive for COVID-19 and 1412\nthat tested negative. From this sample group, 52.6% of the individuals were\nfemale and 47.4% were male. 2.5% were between the age of 0 and 20 , 61.1%\nbetween the age of 21 and 40 , 30.3% between the age of 41 and 60 and 6.1% were\nover 61 years of age.\n  RESULTS: Using the dataset of 2821 individuals our results showed that the\nneural network classifier was able to discriminate between the COVID-19\npositive and the healthy coughs with an accuracy of 88%. This accuracy obtained\nduring the training process was later tested and confirmed with a second\ndataset corresponding to 492 individuals.",

        "abstract": "In March of 2020, many U.S. state governments encouraged or mandated\nrestrictions on social interactions to slow the spread of COVID-19, the disease\ncaused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has spread to nearly 180\ncountries. Estimating the effectiveness of these social-distancing strategies\nis challenging because surveillance of COVID-19 has been limited, with tests\ngenerally being prioritized for high-risk or hospitalized cases according to\ntemporally and regionally varying criteria. Here we show that reductions in\nmobility across U.S. counties with at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led\nto reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a\nmean lag of 6.5 days ($90\\%$ within 3--10 days) that is consistent with the\nincubation period of COVID-19. Furthermore, counties with larger decreases in\nmobility subsequently achieved greater reductions in fevers ($p<0.01$), with\nthe notable exception of New York City and its immediate vicinity. These\nresults indicate that social distancing has reduced the transmission of\ninfluenza like illnesses, including COVID 19, and support social distancing as\nan effective strategy for slowing the spread of COVID-19.",

The study\nrevealed that statistics related to social distancing, namely trip rate, miles\ntraveled per person, and percentage of population staying at home have all\nshowed an unexpected trend, which we named social distancing inertia. The\ntrends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics\nstarted improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a\nportion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing\nvoluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However,\nafter about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite\nthe continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a\nnatural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the\nextent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national\ndata showed that the inertia phenomenon is universal, happening in all the U.S.\nstates and for all the studied statistics.

        "abstract": "Recent studies conclude that the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\ndecreased power sector CO$_2$ emissions globally and in the United States. In\nthis paper, we analyze the statistical significance of CO2 emissions reductions\nin the U.S. power sector from March through December 2020. We use Gaussian\nprocess (GP) regression to assess whether CO2 emissions reductions would have\noccurred with reasonable probability in the absence of COVID-19 considering\nuncertainty due to factors unrelated to the pandemic and adjusting for weather,\nseasonality, and recent emissions trends. We find that monthly CO2 emissions\nreductions are only statistically significant in April and May 2020 considering\nhypothesis tests at 5% significance levels. Separately, we consider the\npotential impact of COVID-19 on coal-fired power plant retirements through\n2022. We find that only a small percentage of U.S. coal power plants are at\nrisk of retirement due to a possible COVID-19-related sustained reduction in\nelectricity demand and prices.

It is a complex\nbio-mechanical process that is highly sensitive to changes in the speaker's\nrespiratory parameters. Since most symptomatic cases of COVID-19 present with\nmoderate to severe impairment of respiratory functions, we hypothesize that\nsignatures of COVID-19 may be observable by examining the vibrations of the\nvocal folds. Our goal is to validate this hypothesis, and to quantitatively\ncharacterize the changes observed to enable the detection of COVID-19 from\nvoice. For this, we use a dynamical system model for the oscillation of the\nvocal folds, and solve it using our recently developed ADLES algorithm to yield\nvocal fold oscillation patterns directly from recorded speech. Experimental\nresults on a clinically curated dataset of COVID-19 positive and negative\nsubjects reveal characteristic patterns of vocal fold oscillations that are\ncorrelated with COVID-19. We show that these are prominent and discriminative\nenough that even simple classifiers such as logistic regression yields high\ndetection accuracies using just the recordings of isolated extended vowels.",

The limited quantity of testing kits\nand increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep\nLearning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19\ncases using chest X-rays.\n  Methods\n  In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model\nto automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The\nproposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet\ndataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and\nother chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available\ndatabases.\n  Results and Conclusion\n  CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the\nexperimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy\nof 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases\nare 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia\nviral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal),\nthe proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary\nresults of this study look promising which can be further improved as more\ntraining data becomes available. Overall, the proposed model substantially\nadvances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic,\nit can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid\nthem in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.",

The\npublic reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus\nnew cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and\nmachine learning approaches can be leveraged for infodemiology study by\nstudying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19.\nReal-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can\nbe promising for public health emergency responses and planning.

Practices\nfor testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary geographically in Russia. For\nexample, in the city of St. Petersburg, where mortality rate for COVID-19 is\nthe highest in the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020, every death for\nCOVID-19 corresponds to 15.7 detected cases of COVID-19 in the population,\nwhile the corresponding number for the whole of Russia is 58.1, suggesting\nlimited detection of mild/moderate cases of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg.\nMethods: More active testing for SARS-CoV-2 results in lower case-fatality\nratio (i.e. the proportion of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of\nSARS-CoV-2 infection in the population). We used data on COVID-19 cases and\ndeaths to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of\nmortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results:\nThe correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for\nCOVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020 is\n0.64 (0.50,0.75). For several regions of the Russian Federation, detectability\nof SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively low, while rates of mortality for\nCOVID-19 are relatively high. Conclusions: Detectability of the SARS-CoV-2\ninfection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality from\nCOVID-19. To increase detectability, one ought to test all individuals with\nrespiratory symptoms seeking medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to\nundertake additional measures to increase the volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.\nSuch measures, in combination with quarantine for infected cases and their\nclose contacts help to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and\ndiminish the related mortality.",

Numerous studies have proposed to use Deep Learning\ntechniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, they have used very limited chest\nX-ray (CXR) image repositories for evaluation with a small number, a few\nhundreds, of COVID-19 samples. Moreover, these methods can neither localize nor\ngrade the severity of COVID-19 infection. For this purpose, recent studies\nproposed to explore the activation maps of deep networks. However, they remain\ninaccurate for localizing the actual infestation making them unreliable for\nclinical use. This study proposes a novel method for the joint localization,\nseverity grading, and detection of COVID-19 from CXR images by generating the\nso-called infection maps. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest\ndataset with 119,316 CXR images including 2951 COVID-19 samples, where the\nannotation of the ground-truth segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a\nnovel collaborative human-machine approach.

A detailed set of experiments show that state-of-the-art\nsegmentation networks can learn to localize COVID-19 infection with an F1-score\nof 83.20%, which is significantly superior to the activation maps created by\nthe previous methods.

Studies\nhave shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial\npneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images\ncan speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack\nsufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\n(RT-PCR) tests.

Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires\ntime and resources which could further strain health care systems and\nradiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study,\nwe propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects\nimages of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal\nand Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the\nunknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available\nCOVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia,\nand COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use\ntransfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why\nsegmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the\ntask of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from\ndifferent resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show\nimproved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model\n(RANDGAN) compared to conventional generative adversarial networks (GANs) for\nanomaly detection in medical images, improving the area under the ROC curve\nfrom 0.71 to 0.77.",

Given the effects of COVID-19\non pulmonary tissues, chest radiographic imaging has become a necessity for\nscreening and monitoring the disease. Numerous studies have proposed Deep\nLearning approaches for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Although these\nmethods achieved astonishing performance in detection, they have used limited\nchest X-ray (CXR) repositories for evaluation, usually with a few hundred\nCOVID-19 CXR images only. Thus, such data scarcity prevents reliable evaluation\nwith the potential of overfitting. In addition, most studies showed no or\nlimited capability in infection localization and severity grading of COVID-19\npneumonia. In this study, we address this urgent need by proposing a systematic\nand unified approach for lung segmentation and COVID-19 localization with\ninfection quantification from CXR images. To accomplish this, we have\nconstructed the largest benchmark dataset with 33,920 CXR images, including\n11,956 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of ground-truth lung segmentation\nmasks is performed on CXRs by a novel human-machine collaborative approach.

Furthermore, COVID-19\ninfections of various shapes and types were reliably localized with 83.05% IoU\nand 88.21% DSC.

These periods reveal\na sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting\nwith a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern\nintermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending\nup with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek\nCOVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation.

The\noverall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel\nmethod for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which\nallows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better\nforecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices\nand management that may help other countries improve their performance in the\nwar against COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded\nin Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic\naround the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also\nbe fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in\nAlgeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness\nmay result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and\nprogressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using\nreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden\nstandard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives.\nMoreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources\nmay also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such\ncircumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis\nand prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly\nsupervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19\ninfection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of\nmanual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection\ndetection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the\npromising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a\nwide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "Official counts of COVID-19 deaths have been criticized for potentially\nincluding people who did not die of COVID-19 but merely died with COVID-19. I\naddress that critique by fitting a generalized additive model to weekly counts\nof all deaths registered in England and Wales during the 2010s. The model\nproduces baseline rates of death registrations expected without the COVID-19\npandemic, and comparing those baselines to recent counts of registered deaths\nexposes the emergence of excess deaths late in March 2020. By April's end,\nEngland and Wales registered 45,300 $\\pm$ 3200 excess deaths of adults aged\n45+. Through 22 May, the last day of available all-deaths data, 56,600 $\\pm$\n4400 were registered (about 53% of which were of men). Both the ONS's\ncorresponding count of 43,205 death certificates which mention COVID-19, and\nthe Department of Health and Social Care's count of 33,671 deaths, are\nappreciably less, implying that their counting methods have underestimated, not\noverestimated, the pandemic's true death toll. If underreporting rates have\nheld steady during May, about 59,000 direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths might\nhave been registered through the end of May but not yet publicly reported in\nfull.",

We discuss the effect of\nnationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the\nspread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is\nused to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of\nnationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its\nremoval on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the\npeak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020.\nWe also predict a 7$\\%$ to 21$\\%$ increase in the peak value of active infected\ncases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation\nin the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown\nperiod. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a\nnon-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to\nprolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public\nhealth-care system.

In particular, this paper looks at the deep\nconvolutional neural networks VGG16 and VGG19, InceptionResNetV2 and\nInceptionV3, as well as Xception, all followed by a flat multi-layer perceptron\nand a final 30% drop-out. The paper has found that the best performing network\nis VGG16 with a final $30$% drop-out trained over 3 classes (COVID-19, No\nFinding, Other Pneumonia). It has an internal cross-validated accuracy of\n$93.9(\\pm3.4)$%, a COVID-19 sensitivity of $87.7(-1.9,+2)$%, and a No Finding\nsensitivity of $96.8(\\pm0.8)$%. The respective external cross-validated values\nare $84.1(\\pm13.5)$%, $87.7(-1.9,2)$%, and $96.8(\\pm0.8)$%. The model optimizer\nwas Adam with a 1e-4 learning rate, and categorical cross-entropy loss. It is\nhoped that, once this research will be put to practice in hospitals, healthcare\nprofessionals will be able in the medium to long-term to diagnosing through\nmachine learning tools possible pneumonia, and if detected, whether it is\nlinked to a COVID-19 infection, allowing the detection of new possible COVID-19\nfoyers after the end of possible \"stop-and-go\" lockdowns as expected by until a\nvaccine is found and widespread. Furthermore, in the short-term, it is hoped\npractitioners can compare the diagnosis from the deep convolutional neural\nnetworks with possible RT-PCR testing results, and if clashing, a Computed\nTomography could be performed as they are more accurate in showing COVID-19\npneumonia.",

        "abstract": "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly altered our lifestyles\nas we resort to minimize the spread through preventive measures such as social\ndistancing and quarantine. An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between\nthe exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures.\nThis gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its\npreventive measures. Nowadays, social media platforms (ie., Twitter) are\nfrequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In\nthis paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19\nby analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that,\nwe collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most\naffected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related\ntrends, 2) the volume of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3)\nthe user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries\nwith a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to\nexpedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also\nobserved that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated\nbefore the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive\nattempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in\ncountries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19\npreventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social\nmedia usage can influence public behavior, which can be leveraged to better\ncombat future pandemics.",

This study reports an\nintegrative, network-based deep learning methodology to identify repurposable\ndrugs for COVID-19 (termed CoV-KGE). Specifically, we built a comprehensive\nknowledge graph that includes 15 million edges across 39 types of relationships\nconnecting drugs, diseases, genes, pathways, and expressions, from a large\nscientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications. Using Amazon AWS computing\nresources, we identified 41 repurposable drugs (including indomethacin,\ntoremifene and niclosamide) whose therapeutic association with COVID-19 were\nvalidated by transcriptomic and proteomic data in SARS-CoV-2 infected human\ncells and data from ongoing clinical trials. While this study, by no means\nrecommends specific drugs, it demonstrates a powerful deep learning methodology\nto prioritize existing drugs for further investigation, which holds the\npotential of accelerating therapeutic development for COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "Due to the shortage of COVID-19 viral testing kits and the long waiting time,\nradiology imaging is used to complement the screening process and triage\npatients into different risk levels. Deep learning based methods have taken an\nactive role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images,\nas witnessed in many recent works in early 2020. Most of these works first\ntrain a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest\nx-ray image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much\nsmaller scale. However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains\nmay lead to poor performance for CNN due to two issues, the large domain shift\npresent in the biomedical imaging datasets and the extremely small scale of the\nCOVID-19 chest x-ray dataset. In an attempt to address these two important\nissues, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification\nin a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting and propose a novel\ndomain adaptation method, Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network\n(SODA). SODA is able to align the data distributions across different domains\nin a general domain space and also in a common subspace of source and target\ndata. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance\ncompared with recent state-of-the-art models in separating COVID-19 with common\npneumonia. We also present initial results showing that SODA can produce better\npathology localizations in the chest x-rays.",
